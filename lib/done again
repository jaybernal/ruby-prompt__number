# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

Fixnum (Integer) and Floats (numbers with decimals)

# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

+ - * / % **
 == <= >= < > != <=>

When a decimal is present in a calculation, ruby stores it as a float and will it over for future calculation.
y = 7 + 4.0 => 11.0
z = y + 3 = 15.0
y.class => float
z.class => flaot

y = 7 + 4
z = y + 3.0
y.class => fixnum
z.class => flaot

i = 7 + 4 => 11
j = i + 3 => 15
i.class => fixnum
j.class => fixnum

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

when using the '+' sign on numbers it will add the value ie. 5 + 5 = 10
when using the '+' sign with strings it will join strings togehter ie. 'hello' + ' jay' = 'hello jay'

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

'20'.to_i + 2 = 22

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

The times method provides an alternative to the 'for' loop. The times method allows a specific number of times to pass through the block.
for example
5.times{|i| puts "jay"}
